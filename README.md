# note-taker
Week 11 Challenge

In this challenge, I was given starter code which was not fully complete. The front-end was complete but the back-end still needed to be built. The application is supposed to be a functioning server which can manage user notes. It contains the following features:

- take notes and save them to a local server

- previous notes appear in a column on the left side


## Installation
To install this application you will need Node.js and Express.js installed on your computer. Once installed download the files from the repository and navigate to /note-taker in your terminal. Use the following commands to install the required dependencies:
```
npm i
```
Once dependencies have been installed you will need to make the server live. To do so navigate to /note-taker and  use the following command:
```
npm start
```
Once the server is live, open your web browser at go to http://localhost:3001/ 


## User Story
```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```

WHEN I open the Note Taker

WHEN I click on the link to the notes page

WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save button
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation
WHEN I click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page
